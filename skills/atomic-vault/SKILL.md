# Atomic Vault Workflow

The vault is Atomic's built-in project management and context system. It tracks **goals** (work sessions), **intents** (units of work), and **memory** (persistent knowledge). Always use vault commands to stay organized.

## Core Concepts

- **Intent**: A unit of work (like a ticket). Has an ID, title, status, and a deliverable markdown file.
- **Goal**: A focused work session tied to one or more intents. Tracks what you're actively doing.
- **Memory**: Persistent knowledge entries the vault retains across sessions.

## Intent Commands

```bash
atomic vault intent list                # List all intents (CHECK THIS FIRST)
atomic vault intent create "title"      # Create a new intent
atomic vault intent show <id>           # Show intent details
atomic vault intent update <id> --status <status>  # Update intent status
atomic vault intent link <id> --goal <goal>         # Link intent to a goal
```

### Intent Statuses

`backlog` → `planned` → `in-progress` → `review` → `done`

### CRITICAL RULE: Always Check Before Creating

Before creating any intent, run `atomic vault intent list` first. Duplicate intents cause confusion and waste effort. Only create a new intent if no existing one covers the work.

## Goal Commands

```bash
atomic vault goal start "goal name"     # Start a new work session
atomic vault goal stop                  # Stop the current goal
atomic vault goal resume <name>         # Resume a suspended goal
atomic vault goal list                  # List all goals
```

### Goal Statuses

- **active** — Currently being worked on
- **suspended** — Paused (via `goal stop`), can be resumed
- **completed** — Finished

## Memory Commands

```bash
atomic vault memory list                # List all memory entries
atomic vault memory show <key>          # Show a specific memory entry
echo "value" | atomic vault memory write <key>   # Write a memory entry
echo "value" | atomic vault memory write <key> --type feedback  # Write feedback memory
```

## The Intent File Is the Deliverable

Each intent has a markdown file at `.vault/intents/<id>/intent.md`. This file IS the deliverable — fill it in completely:

```markdown
## Description
What this intent accomplishes and why.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2

## Files to Modify
- `path/to/file.rs` — what changes and why

## Approach
Step-by-step plan for implementation.

## Test Strategy
How to verify the work is correct.

## Notes
Any additional context, decisions, or open questions.
```

After editing intent markdown files, run `atomic vault sync` to persist changes back to the vault database. Always `atomic vault sync` **before** `atomic vault intent show`/`update` — the CLI reads from the vault database, not the file, so an unsynced `show` renders the stale placeholder template and `update` re-materializes the database copy over the file, clobbering your edits. `sync` is not `atomic record`/`add` and is required in both IDE and CLI mode; hooks do not do it for you.

## Full Workflow (End to End)

Follow this sequence for every piece of work:

### 1. Check existing intents

```bash
atomic vault intent list
```

Look for an existing intent that matches your task. Do NOT create duplicates.

### 2. Create ONE intent (if needed)

```bash
atomic vault intent create --title "Implement user authentication"
```

Create exactly one intent per unit of work. Fill in the intent file at `.vault/intents/<id>/intent.md`.

### 3. Start a goal

```bash
atomic vault goal start --name "auth-implementation"
atomic vault intent link <intent-id> --goal auth-implementation
```

### 4. Get into the session view

How the draft view is set up depends on the environment:

- **IDE (hooks active):** nothing to do. Session start automatically forks a haikunator-named draft view (e.g. `early-ridge-ffd9`) from your current view and switches into it. Your whole session runs inside it, and session end switches back. Do **not** create or switch views.
- **CLI `[CLI only]`:** create and switch into a draft view yourself:
  ```bash
  atomic view create auth-feature --draft
  atomic view switch auth-feature
  ```
  Draft views are isolated workspaces — create one for new work.

### 5. Do the work and record changes

Write code and iterate. How changes get recorded depends on the environment:

- **IDE (hooks active):** you do **not** run `atomic add` or `atomic record`. Turn end records automatically — the hook runs `status` → `add` (tracks new files) → `record --all` with full AI provenance (model, tokens, cost, session, decision graph). To review what the hooks recorded, use the `atomic-vcs` skill: `atomic log -f oneline`, then `atomic change -p -a`.
- **CLI `[CLI only]`:** track and record manually. Record frequently — small, focused changes are better than large ones:
  ```bash
  atomic add src/auth.rs
  atomic add src/auth_test.rs
  atomic record -m "feat: add user authentication module"
  ```

### 6. Update intent status

```bash
atomic vault sync                                  # persist file edits first
atomic vault intent update <id> --status review
```

Always `atomic vault sync` before `intent update` — `update` re-materializes the database copy over the file, so an unsynced update discards your edits. This applies in both IDE and CLI mode.

### 7. Stop the goal when done

```bash
atomic vault goal stop
atomic vault sync
atomic vault intent update <id> --status done
```

### 8. Sync vault state

```bash
atomic vault sync
```

A final sync ensures every vault edit is in the database. In IDE mode it also guarantees your edits are captured by the turn's automatic record.

## Resuming Work

If you stopped a goal and need to come back:

```bash
atomic vault goal list                  # Find the suspended goal
atomic vault goal resume "auth-implementation"
atomic view switch auth-feature         # [CLI only] switch back to the draft view
# Continue working...
```

In IDE mode, skip the `atomic view switch` — the hooks manage the session view for you; just resume the goal and continue.

## Learning from Redirected Prompts

When a user cancels, redirects, or corrects your approach mid-turn, treat it as a learning signal. Write a memory entry so the same mistake isn't repeated in future sessions.

### When to write a redirect memory

- User says "no, that's not what I meant" or "stop, do it differently"
- User cancels a tool call or asks you to undo an action
- User corrects an assumption you made about their codebase, workflow, or preferences
- User redirects the approach after seeing your plan

### How to write it

```bash
echo "<what was tried> -> <why it was wrong> -> <what to do instead>" \
  | atomic vault memory write "redirect/<short-slug>" --type feedback
```

**Examples:**

```bash
# User corrected a wrong tool choice
echo "Used grep to search code -> user prefers atomic vault query -> always try atomic query first" \
  | atomic vault memory write "redirect/no-grep-use-atomic" --type feedback

# User redirected an architectural decision
echo "Added a new abstraction layer -> user wants minimal code -> match existing patterns only" \
  | atomic vault memory write "redirect/no-new-abstractions" --type feedback

# User cancelled a destructive action
echo "Attempted to delete files without asking -> always confirm before any destructive operation" \
  | atomic vault memory write "redirect/confirm-before-delete" --type feedback
```

### Key naming convention

Use `redirect/<slug>` as the key so redirect memories are grouped and easy to scan:

```bash
atomic vault memory list | grep redirect/
```

### Check redirect memories at session start

At the start of a new session, scan for redirect memories to apply learned preferences:

```bash
atomic vault memory list
```

Look for any `redirect/` entries relevant to the current task and apply them proactively.

## Tips

- One intent per unit of work — keep them focused
- Start every session by checking `atomic vault intent list` and `atomic vault goal list`
- Fill in the intent markdown completely before starting implementation
- Run `atomic vault sync` after editing any vault markdown file, and before every `show`/`update` — in both IDE and CLI mode
- Draft views keep your work isolated until it's ready to insert into a shared view. In IDE mode the hooks fork the draft view at session start, record at turn end, and restore your view at session end — you don't manage views or recording. **`[CLI only]`** create and switch into a draft view yourself before starting new work.
- Inspect what was recorded — diff, provenance, AI attestation — with the `atomic-vcs` skill
- Write `redirect/` memories immediately when a user corrects your approach — don't wait until end of turn
